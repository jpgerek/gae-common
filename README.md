Common code I use in some GAE projects, it provides:

    - Basic folder hierarchy.
    - Memcache.
    - Cachepy.
    - HTTP caching.
    - Sending emails using queues using gae, or sendgrid with a http remote request.
    - Previewing emails in the browser.
    - Shorting urls using bit.ly.
    - Templates.
    - 404 page.
    - Error page.
    - Decorators to cache using memcache and/or cachepy.
    - Decorator to cache urls.
    - Decorator to limit the requests by url, time and ip.
    - Decorator to retry a function call when it fails.
    - Some helpers to validate and filter params.
